# DriveGit
Interacting with Google Drive

The project is still in development


The aim is to create a script using python and PyDrive to perform common operations like listing files, uploading and downloading files, and syncing between a local folder and a folder on google drive. We take the commands from user, and want to give him an experience as if he is using a terminal to interact with Drive.
